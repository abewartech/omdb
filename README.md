## Laravel Breeze, Inertia.js, and PHP 8.2 Project

This project was created for the purpose of learning how to use Laravel Breeze and Inertia.js, as well as trying out the latest version of PHP (8.2).

The project consists of a login and registration page, as well as pages for viewing a list of movies, viewing the details of a specific movie, and marking movies as favorites.

This project also implements multi-language support and uses the OMDB API for movie data. It also includes lazy loading and infinite scrolling, with React serving as the frontend and Antd as the UI framework.
